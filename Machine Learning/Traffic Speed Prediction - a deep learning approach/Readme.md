In this project, I: <br>
Achieved speed predictions within a root mean square error of 5 mph by stacking 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with encoder-decoder and bi-directional Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) <br>
Converted 187Gb data to SQLite databases using pandas to calculate 5 min average flow and speeds for feature generation, used google colab GPUs for model training <br>
