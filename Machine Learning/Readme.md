This folder consists of machine learning projects I have completed so far. The description of these are as follows:

1) __Cuisine_prediction (text mining)__ - A multi-class classification problem, inspired by a Kaggle competition, demonstrating 
application of various text mining approaches and classification algorithms such as XGBoost, random forests, SVM, logistic
regression, etc. Got ranked in top 10 percentile of the Kaggle competition with an accuracy of 80.3% 

2) __Future Sales Prediction__ - Predicted monthly future sales using deep neural networks with categorical embedding, CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest models, and stacked them to improve the overall accuracy by 15%. Used Google Colab GPUs for neural network training and Bayesian optimization for automating the process of hyperparameter tuning 

3) __Traffic speed prediction__ -  Combined _1D CNNs_ with _encoder-decoder network_ and _bi-directional LSTMs_ for short and long term speed predictions using google colab GPUs for neural network training. Converted _187Gb data to SQLite databases_ using pandas data frame chunks and queried 5 min average flow and speed data to create lagged features 4) __SVM-FFA dynamic modulus prediction (publication)__ - Contains code file and article I published as a part of my 
undergraduate thesis. Employed firefly algorithm for SVM hyperparameter search in MATLAB to regress asphalt stiffness 
that effectively decreased the overfitting by 32% w.r.t previously developed ANN models with similar accuracy standards.
