- The aim of the project is to develop a classification model that based on the recipes, predicts what cuisine a 
particular dish belongs to. This project is inspired from a Kaggle competition and the data is taken from the same website.

- Used models such as XGBoost, gradient boosting, random forest, SVM and logistic regression along with various text 
mining pre-processing methods to develop a multi-class classification model for categorizing recipes to 20 cuisines 
using a string of ingredients as predictors, achieving a score in top 12 percentile of the Kaggle competition.
