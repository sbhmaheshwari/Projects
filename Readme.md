I am Saurabh Maheshwari, pursuing master's (M.S.) at UC Davis in transportation engineering. I completed my undergrad at Indian 
Institute of Technology Bombay, where my passion for data science evolved. Currently as a  graduate researcher, I am 
working on parametric/non-parametric estimation of travel demand probability density distribution based on observed flow in the network. Apart from this, I spend a lot of time doing online courses related to machine learning, deep learning and data analysis (_certifications can be found on LinkedIn_), along with some cool self projects in the free time to develop hands on data science skills. Here is the link to my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabh-maheshwari-240396/ 

Some of the skills I have developed are: <br>
__Expertise__: _Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Mining and Visualization_ <br>
__Tools__: _Python, R, MATLAB, SQLite, Keras, TensorFlow, Google Colabs, scikit-learn, Shiny, Leaflet, folium, bokeh, ggplot2_

The repository contains my work at UC Davis and IIT Bombay, the descriptions of which are as follows: 

1) __Machine Learning__ - Contains codes, reports and publications for my machine learning projects completed so far.  
2) __Computational Statistics__ - Course work containing codes as well as approaches to various statistical problems on topics 
such as genetic algorithms, bootstrap, sampling, etc.
 3) __Landslide data analysis (_Heroku, Flask, Bokeh_)__ - Contains interactive bokeh graphics, rendered on heroku using flask. It
 is a fun part of my self learning endeavor 

4) __Network graph automation__ - My work as a graduate researcher at UC Davis. I automated the process of network graph 
formation by coupling freeway data queried using OpenStreetMap API with sensors from PeMS database in R using packages 
like Osmar, Leaflet and dplyr. Then, successfully employed the algorithm to generate adjacency matrix, sensor-link 
relationship, and origin-destination pairs from raw data consisting of 12351 nodes, 2646 links and 400 sensors, 
saving hours of manual effort.

 5) __Shiny Leaflet integration__ - Integrated Shiny and Leaflet packages in R to create user specific online query for the 
Houston ship channel data. App facilitates data exploration of 117K records of 10 different emissions by mapping features 
such as locating highest emission points, tracking high emission ships, etc. instantaneously.
