I am Saurabh Maheshwari, pursuing masters at UC Davis in transportation engineering. I completed my undergrad at Indian 
Institute of Technology Bombay, where my passion for data science evolved. Currently as a  graduate researcher, I am 
working on non-parametric estimation of travel demand density distribution based on observed flow in the network. Apart 
from this, I spend a lot of time doing online courses related to machine learning, deep learning and data analysis, along 
with some cool self projects in the free time to develop hands on data science skills. Here is the link to my LinkedIn 
profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabh-maheshwari-240396/ 

The repository contains my work at UC Davis and IIT Bombay, the descriptions of which are as follows:

1) Computational Statistics - Course work containing codes as well as approaches to various statistical problems on topics 
such as genetic algorithms, bootstrap, sampling, etc.

2) Cuisine_prediction_text_mining - A multi-class classification problem, inspired by a Kaggle competition, demonstrating 
application of various text mining approaches and classification algorithms such as XGBoost, random forests, SVM, logistic
regression, etc.

3) Heroku_Flask_Bokeh (landslide data analysis) - Contains interactive bokeh graphics, rendered on heroku using flask. It
is a fun part of my self learning endeavor.

4) Network graph automation - My work as a graduate researcher at UC Davis. I automated the process of network graph 
formation by coupling freeway data queried using OpenStreetMap API with sensors from PeMS database in R using packages 
like Osmar, Leaflet and dplyr. Then, successfully employed the algorithm to generate adjacency matrix, sensor-link 
relationship, and origin-destination pairs from raw data consisting of 12351 nodes, 2646 links and 400 sensors, 
saving hours of manual effort.

5) Shiny Leaflet integration - Integrated Shiny and Leaflet packages in R to create user specific online query for the 
Houston ship channel data. App facilitates data exploration of 117K records of 10 different emissions by mapping features 
such as locating highest emission points, tracking high emission ships, etc. instantaneously.

6) SVM-FFA dynamic modulus prediction (publication) - Contains code file and article I published as a part of my 
undergraduate thesis. Employed firefly algorithm for SVM hyperparameter search in MATLAB to regress asphalt stiffness 
that effectively decreased the overfitting by 32% w.r.t previously developed ANN models with similar accuracy standards.
